# heif-go

A Go encoder/decoder for HEIF/HEIC without system dependencies (CGO).

## üí° Motivation

There are a couple of libraries to encode/decode HEIF images in Go, and even though they do the job well, they have one limitation that don't satisfy my needs: they either depend on libraries to be installed on the system in order to be built and/or later be executed.

**heif-go** uses CGO to create a static implementation of HEIF/HEIC, so you don't need to have `libheif` (or any of its sub-dependencies) installed to build or run your Go application.

It also runs on native code (supports `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `windows/amd64`), so it achieves the best performance possible.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

This library can be installed using Go modules. To do that run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
$ go get github.com/vegidio/heif-go
```

## ü§ñ Usage

This is a CGO library so in order to use it you _must_ enable CGO while building your application. You can do that by setting the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`:

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLED=1 go build /path/to/your/app.go
```

Here are some examples of how to encode and decode HEIF/HEIC images using this library. These snippets don't have any error handling for the sake of simplicity, but you should always check for errors in production code.

### Encoding

```go
var originalImage image.Image = ... // an image.Image to be encoded
heicFile, err := os.Create("/path/to/image.heic") // create the file to save the HEIC
err = heif.Encode(heicFile, originalImage, nil) // encode the image & save it to the file
```

### Decoding

```go
import _ "github.com/vegidio/heif-go" // do a blank import to register the HEIC decoder
heicFile, err := os.Open("/path/to/image.heic") // open the HEIC file to be decoded
heicImage, _, err := image.Decode(heicFile) // decode the image
```

## üí£ Troubleshooting

### I cannot build my app after importing this library

If you cannot build your app after importing **heif-go**, it is probably because you didn't set the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable to `1`.

You must either set a global environment variable with `export CGO_ENABLED=1` or set it in the command line when building your app with `CGO_ENABLED=1 go build /path/to/your/app.go`.
